Description: This package provides methods to identify active
        transcriptional programs. Methods and classes are provided to
        import or infer large scale co-regulatory network from
        transcriptomic data. The specificity of the encoded networks is
        to model Transcription Factor cooperation. External regulation
        evidences (TFBS, ChIP,...) can be integrated to assess the
        inferred network and refine it if necessary. Transcriptional
        activity of the regulators in the network can be estimated
        using an measure of their influence in a given sample. Finally,
        an interactive UI can be used to navigate through the network
        of cooperative regulators and to visualize their activity in a
        specific sample or subgroup sample. The proposed visualization
        tool can be used to integrate gene expression, transcriptional
        activity, copy number status, sample classification and a
        transcriptional network including co-regulation information.
